    # TODO: Ideally, we would validate the Program info, like that there are Cohort Schedules and the "Coach Course Section Name" field is set,
    # at the time we're launching it instead of as part of the background job (where this is run). That way we can give immediate feedback if they're trying
    # to launch a program that has not been setup properly with the info we need to be able to launch it. This makes me wonder if we
    # should be introducing back a local platform Program model that represents the mapping of all the program related stuff. E.g.
    # we could use it to map LC to Accelerator courses. We could store the Cohort and Cohort Schedule names and use them to do the sync
    # logic when there are new ones or changes. We could store the state of the program, whether it's active or not, so that we can filter out
    # access to old content for returning LCs or Fellows who drop but come back for a future run. E.g current LCs shouldn't see attendance for
    # for attendance assignments for previous semesters event though they are in those sections.
    #
    # If we did that, then we could create the Program active record before launching the job which does this validation in the main UI
    # and then pass it to the job using a GlobalID parameter: https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html#globalid
    # Task to track: https://app.asana.com/0/1174274412967132/1198877695027085
