  # PROPOSAL: as we model this out, here is goal I want to propose:
  # Divorce the logic of how a "course" is laid out including what content, projects, lessons
  # grading rules, etc from the logic needed to actually execute a course and the logistics
  # inolved in running it. E.g. the people in it, their role, the due dates, the submissions,
  # etc.
  #
  # We shouldn't have to copy everything over and over again when it's the same "course."
  # A "course_template" should just point to a course and have all the administration / logistics
  # tied to the course_template. So a course is an "instance" of a course_template that we are
  # executing for a given semester at a given school.
