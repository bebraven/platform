// DON'T ADD YOUR OWN CSS HERE. This file is only for importing CSS from
// node.js packages.
//
// Context: We use the Rails Sprockets pipeline to bundle all assets, 
// with the exception of Javascript. In other words: all custom
// CSS, images, etc should go somewhere in the app/assets directory.
//
// This file and everything under app/javascript is only for javascript which
// is bundled using Webpacker. Hence why it's called app/javascript.
//
// However, some node.js modules have their own CSS and other assets.
// That's where this (and any other stylesheet or non-javascript asset) under
// app/javascript comes in. It's to bundle assets that are part of javascript
// packages that we don't control.
//
// This article does a decent job of talking about this whole thang:
