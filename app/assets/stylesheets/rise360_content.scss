// This file allows us to apply our own CSS to Rise360 Module content.
//
// It's a bit non-standard b/c we compile it as a standalone CSS file
// rather than bundle it together with other CSS for the layout b/c it's
// injected into the Rise360 content using Javascript. See:
// app/javascript/packs/rise360_module_versions.js.erb
//
// DEV NOTE: changes here won't take effect in development until you force
// Webpacker to recompile the above Javascript file

// ##########
// IMPORTANT: avoid adding styles here as much as possible!!!
// #########
// It's not maintainable to add styles here.  For everything we add, the odds
// of Rise360 changing their HTML and it just suddenly breaking one day causing us
// to rush out a fix and have to deal with both old and new HTML rises.
// We likely won't have a good way to proactively detect this either.
// Avoid this at all costs and make sure you've pushed back on the
// the Designer or Product Manager that is pushing for this change, being very
// clear that it's brittle and WILL just suddenly break one day causing fires and headaches.

// TODO: add custom styles to overwrite the Rise360 ones that we need here.

// TODO: remove this, just an example that makes the first button text green as a proof of concept.
