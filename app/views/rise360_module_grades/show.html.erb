      <%# Note: we consciously made the decision not to add a button that allows folks to
        force the grade to be recalculated. The reason is b/c the Rise360ModuleInteractions
        table is likely going to be our biggest, most used table in the database and the
        grade computation is resource intensive. In the future, we should figure out how to
        compute the grade in real-time as they progress through the module as a solution
        (while not sending "your grade as been updated" email notifications)/. For now, the UX of just
        waiting is day feels pretty ok and a button doesn't actually provide much real value add.

    <h2 class="bv-font-size-4">How are Modules graded?</h2>
    <p>
      Modules are graded nightly. The grade consists of two components:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-6 col-md-3">Engagement:</div><div class="col-1"><strong>50%</strong></div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-6 col-md-3">Mastery quizzes:</div><div class="col-1"><strong>50%</strong></div>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3 class="bv-font-size-5 mt-4">How do you get engagement credit?</h3>
    <p>
      You get credit for engagement just by going through the Module.
      If you get to the end then you get full credit for the engagement portion
      of the Module which is half of your overall grade.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="bv-font-size-5"><strong>How do you get credit for mastery quizzes?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      You get credit for mastery quizzes by getting the answers correct. If there are ten
      total mastery questions and you get them all right then you get full credit for the
      master portion of the Module which is also half of your overall grade.
    </p>

    <h3 class="bv-font-size-5"><strong>Here is an example of how a Module is graded:</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Say you do 80% of the Module and get nine out of ten of the mastery questions right.
      Your grade is calculated as:
    </p>
    <p><code>(Engagement grade) + (Mastery grade) = (Total grade)</code></p>
    <p><code>(80% of 50%) + (90% of 50%) = (X% of total)</code></p>
    <p><code>(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.9 * 0.5) = 0.85</code></p>
    <p>so... </p>
    <p><code>0.85 percent * 10 points = 8.5 points</code></p>
    <p>You'll see <strong>GRADE: 8.5 / 10</strong> at the top in this example.</p>
